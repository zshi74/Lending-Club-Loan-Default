# Lending-Club-Loan-Default-Prediction

## About Lending Club

Lending club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, in which investors provide funds for potential borrowers and investors earn a profit depending on the risk they take (the borrowers credit score). Lending club provides the "bridge" between investors and borrowers. You can get more information about the company [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/). 

## Purpose of This Analysis

This dataset contains information about lending club's loans that were issued between January 2015 and September 2016. 

In this analysis, I will investigate the variables that can be used to make business rules to reduce the default rate, and build predictive models to effectively predict a potential borrower's chance of default.
